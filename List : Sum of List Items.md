# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:
```python
numbers = eval(input())
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    if num % 10 == 2:
        total += num
print("Sum=", total)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the python program was executed successfully.
